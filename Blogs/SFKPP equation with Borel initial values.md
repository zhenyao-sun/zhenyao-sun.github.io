# Stochasti FKPP equation can have Borel initial values

Zhenyao Sun, last edit: Apr 7, 2022.

Both [^MuellerMtnikRyzhik2021TheSpeed] and [^BlathHammerNie2020TheStochastic] considere the Borel initial values for the reaction diffusion equations 
$$
\partial_t u = \Delta u + f(u)+\sigma(u) \dot W.
$$
When $\sigma(u)= \sqrt{u(1-u)}$ , the $f=au(1-u)$, the weak existence and weak uniquness holds for any Borel initial value $u_0 \in \mathscr B(\mathbb R,[0,1])$. Also a corresponding duality formula holds. Those are made precise in  [^BlathHammerNie2020TheStochastic]
