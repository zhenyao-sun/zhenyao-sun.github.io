# White noise is the Clindrical Brownian motions

Zhenyao Sun, last edit: Apr 22, 2022.

There are two school of stochastic integrals used for SPDE:

Walsh's theory of martingale measures and Krylov-Rozovskii-Da Prato-Zabczyk's theory of Hilbert-space-valued stochastic integrals.

What's their relationship? Basically, for the whith noise and standard cylindrical B.M. they are the same! This is well explanined in [^DalangQureSardanyons2011Stochastic]. See also this [slides](https://www.newton.ac.uk/files/seminar/20100629113012201-152422.pdf).
