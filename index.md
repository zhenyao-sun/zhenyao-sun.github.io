- <img src="Files/selfie2020.jpg" alt="selfie" style="float:right;zoom:7%;margin:100px 300px;"/>I am an Assitant Professor at [School of Mathmatics and Statistics at Beijing Institute of Technology](https://math.bit.edu.cn/)
- Before, I was a Postdoc student of [Faculty of Data and Decision Sciences at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology](https://dds.technion.ac.il/) hosted by [Prof. Leonid Mytnik](https://web.iem.technion.ac.il/site/academicstaff/leonid-mytnik/). 
- I got my Ph.D. at the [School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/puremath_en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Yan-Xia Ren](http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/renyx/indexE.htm). 
- I also visited [Prof. Renming Song](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~rsong/) as a joint Ph.D. student at [Mathematics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://math.illinois.edu/). 
- I got my B.S. at the School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University. 
- My research interest is probability theory, with a focus on models related to branching processes.

   - There is a mistake when we cite H. Kesten, P. Ney and F. Spitzer’s 1966 paper: we can not obtain (1.2) when $\sigma = \infty$. This does not affect the other part of the paper.
