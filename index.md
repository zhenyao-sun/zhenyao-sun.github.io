# Zhenyao Sun's Home Page

- <img src="selfie2020.jpg" alt="selfie" style="float:right;zoom:7%;margin:100px 300px;"/>I am a Postdoc student of [The Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology](https://web.iem.technion.ac.il/en/programs/undergraduate/industrial-engineering-and-management/about.html) hosted by [Prof. Leonid Mytnik](https://web.iem.technion.ac.il/site/academicstaff/leonid-mytnik/). 
- Before, I got my Ph.D. at the [School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/puremath_en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Yan-Xia Ren](http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/renyx/indexE.htm). 
- I also visited [Prof. Renming Song](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~rsong/) as a joint Ph.D. student at [Mathematics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://math.illinois.edu/). 
- I got my B.S. at the School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University. 
- My research interest is probability theory, with a focus on models related to population dynamics.
